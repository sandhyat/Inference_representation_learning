We tested two methods to see whether the alerts are being used to learn the joint modality representation.
To achieve this, we decided to see if the projected representations can predict the overall relevance of the alert.
The two methods are as follows:

1) Summary based where for each patient the alerts (taking value in {+1,-1}) are summed over the time dimension.
Next, we obtain the projected representation from all modalities except the outcomes and sum them for each patient.
Finally, we set up a regression model where there are projected repr dimension number of independent variables and overall relevance (summed across time) as the dependent variable.
Here, all the patients including those who didn't have an alert during the procedure were also included in the regression fit.

2) In this method, we only consider the patients for which there was an alert. For the ones with multiple alerts we randomly select one of them.
 We identify the time when the alert went off and obtain the flow and med representation until that time point which is further passed to the projection layers.
After that the remaining preop modality representations are added to the flow and med representation.
Finally, we set up a binary prediction model where the projected representation until the time of the alert are treated as the predictors and the alert relevance at that time as the variable to predict.
